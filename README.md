This repository contains key points and notes from papers. I have been reading and implementing paper and code from 
more than 2 years and now decided to start writing summaries here. Also on top of the each summary, 
I have provided link of the original paper. I would recommend reader to read paper to get detail knowledge 
and see charts and results.
